# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

Add Code Here
a=16
print(bin(a))

## Output
